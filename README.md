#### About 42  
[42][42] is a free, non profit, project-based, peer-to-peer learning coding school. It originated in France and now has over 20 campuses all over the world. More information can be found [here][42].

<br>

## Objective  
This projects goal is to replicate [OpenSSL][openssl] and some of its functionality.

<br>

## Sources  
**Listed as a Gist -> [Here](https://gist.github.com/rpeepz/376bae6f34ceee9d8efb3a0e0da050bd)**  

---  


## Installation
Download and compile repo:  
``` 
git clone https://github.com/rpeepz/ft_ssl.git  
cd ft_ssl  
make  
```  
Executable `ft_ssl` will be created  
<br>

## Usage  
Message Digest Commands
```
md5 | sha1 | sha224 | sha256 | sha384 | sha512

./ft_ssl { command } [-pqr] [-s string] [files ...]  
```
Chiper Commands _**_
```
base64 | des | des-ecb | des-cbc | des-ofb | des3 | des3-ebc | des3-cbc | des3-ofb

./ft_ssl base64 [-e | -d] [-in file] [-out file]  

./ft_ssl { command } [-a|d|e] [-p passwd] [-k key] [-s salt] [-v vector] [-in file] [-out file]  
```
Standard commands
```
genrsa | prime | rand | rsa | rsautl | version

./ft_ssl genrsa [-out file] [numbits]

./ft_ssl rand [-base64 | -hex] [-out file] num-bytes

./ft_ssl prime [-bits num] [-generate] [-hex] p

./ft_ssl rsa [-check] [-noout] [-in file] [-out file]  [-modulus] [-pubin] [-pubout] [-text] 

./ft_ssl rsautl [-in file] [-out file] [-inkey key] [-pubin] [-encrypt] [-decrypt] [-hexdump]
```
or for help with a command
```
./ft_ssl { command } -h | -help
```

## Dependencies  
* A C language compiler most common would be GCC or Clang.
* Cmake to run the custom Makefile for fast instalation.
* Code was written to run on Unix based systems, it would likely work on a windows machine too but is currently untested. 

<br>

## Future 
It is on my agenda to complete the DES cypher portion on this trio of projects.  
<br>

## Subject PDF
[MD5][pdf1]  
[DES][pdf2]  
[RSA][pdf3]
